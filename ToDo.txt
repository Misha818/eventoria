SECURITY
==========================================================
cloudflare.com

Secure Headers:
You’re using a custom header (X-CSRFToken), which adds an additional layer of security by explicitly sending authentication data.
Consider adding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies on the server to restrict where XHR requests can originate.


Vulnerabilities to Watch For:
CORS Misconfigurations: Allowing unrestricted origins in CORS can expose sensitive data to malicious domains.
Exposing Sensitive Data: Avoid including sensitive information (like passwords) in the request payload or URL.
Unvalidated Inputs: Ensure server-side validation to protect against injection attacks.

Use Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.
Restrict CORS: Only allow trusted domains to access your resources
